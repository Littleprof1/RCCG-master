                            The Bible is the living and active Word of God, it is truth personified. It is timeless, and it’s timely. It’s so old, and yet so fresh. There’s nothing else like it. If you think the Bible is boring then we challenge you to take a closer look at it with us. We believe that God speaks through the Bible, and it’s our constant endeavor to seek to understand His message and apply it to our lives. We hold the scripture in high esteem, and give our absolute best to presenting it passionately, clearly, and relevantly.

                             was crucified for the sins of us all, was buried, rose again from
                              the dead, and ascended to heaven. Colossians 1:13-23 and Colossians 2:8-14;

                            When Jesus walked the earth He made a very simple invitation,
                             “Come follow me.”  Today he makes the same invitation. The bad
                              news is that because of our sin we are all in need of a savior.
                               The great news is the work of Salvation was done when Jesus was
                                crucified, buried, and rose from the dead. For those who accept it,
                                 His finished work on the cross saves us from eternal separation
                                  from Him. Our works don’t save us…the work is already done!

                               and self-control, you know that the Holy Spirit is alive in them.
                                In addition to that, the Holy Spirit can empower believers to
                                 witness and pray beyond their own human capabilities.
